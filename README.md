# PrintSEP2pdf
Print entries in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy to pdf in batch with user css style


## How

1. [Stylus :: add0n.com](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)
2. Chrome
3. Where?
    - `chrome://version/`
    - `chrome://extensions/`
    - copy Stylus's ID, find it in explorer, copy the path
7. customize those paths in `PrintSEP2pdf.py`
8. the `sum2021urls.txt` comes from the ipynb, and it can be customized too
    - check the ipynb for details (when only a certain number of entries are needed, for instance)
10. `python PrintSEP2pdf.py`
11. click to load the user css
12. wait

## notice

1. for Windows(10?) only
2. try adding Chinese Simplified in settings if font missed
3. comments mainly in Chinese, README mainly in broken English, Issue for help
4. maybe on Mac no user-css is needed (as far as I know at least on iOS the layout is much more better), so the codes concerned could be commented.
5. the Stylus may break down after being loaded with Selenium, so fixing may be needed afterwards.

btw, here's the terribly maintained user-css for SEP: [SEP-style/index.user.css at main Â· AlainAlan/SEP-style](https://github.com/AlainAlan/SEP-style/blob/main/index.user.css)

tbh, it's ugly, but works (at least sometimes).
